# AI-Powered POD Automation System Project Overview
Overview
This AI-Powered POD (Print-on-Demand) Automation System combines strategic reasoning agents with tactical execution modules to autonomously generate, optimize, and publish ecommerce products using AI.

The system features a modular architecture with specialized agents, worker modules, continuous learning capabilities, and seamless integration with popular POD platforms like Printify and Etsy.

Features
Multi-Agent Framework: Specialized agents with defined roles (Co-Founder, Lead Developer, Planner, Strategist, Assistant)
POD Worker Modules: Specialized scripts for design generation, mockup creation, SEO optimization, etc.
Continuous Learning System: Self-improving agents that learn from past successes and failures
Advanced Reasoning: Chain-of-thought prompt optimization for complex tasks
Multi-Modal Integration: Combined text and image analysis for better design decisions
API Integrations: Seamless connections with Printify, Etsy, and design generation tools
Containerized Deployment: Easy setup using Docker and Docker Compose
Web Interface: Simple monitoring and control through Streamlit UI
System Architecture
The system consists of two primary components:

Agent Framework - Manages the agent network and their intercommunication
POD Automation Modules - Handles specific POD tasks like design generation, mockups, and publishing
These are supported by:

Memory Systems (SQLite and Weaviate)
Learning System for continuous improvement
Messaging Layer (Memory, Redis, or NATS)
API Integrations for external services
Agent Roles
Agent	Role	Key Capabilities
Co-Founder	Visionary	Strategic decisions, product direction
Lead Developer	Architect	Refactoring, Docker, debugging
Planner	Task Manager	Task decomposition, agent dispatch
Strategist	Market Analyst	Trend tracking, SEO strategy, pricing
Assistant	Task Executor	Listing creation, mockups, publishing
Installation
Prerequisites

Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
Worker Service API: http://localhost:8000
Local Development Setup
Clone the repository:

Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/pod-automation-system.git
cd pod-automation-system
Create and activate a virtual environment:

Copypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

Copypip install -r requirements.txt
Create environment file:

Copycp .env.example .env
Edit .env with your configuration and API keys

Start the services:

Copypython -m main --mode interactive
Usage
Interactive Mode
Interact with the system via the command line:

Copypython -m main --mode interactive
Example commands:

Talk to specific agents: planner: create a new cat-themed product line
View project structure: structure
Read files: read path/to/file.txt
List directories: list directory/path
Batch Mode
Run predefined tasks from a JSON file:

Copypython -m main --mode batch --task tasks.json
Example task file (tasks.json):

Copy[
  {
    "agent": "strategist",
    "description": "Analyze cat t-shirt trends",
    "content": "Analyze current trends for cat-themed t-shirts",
    "context": {
      "type": "trend_analysis"
    }
  },
  {
    "agent": "planner",
    "description": "Plan product line",
    "content": "Create a plan for 5 new cat t-shirt designs",
    "context": {
      "type": "product_planning"
    },
    "delay": 2
  }
]
Web Interface
Access the Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501 for:

System dashboard and monitoring
Agent interaction
Task management
Product creation workflows
System settings
Configuration
Agent Configuration
Each agent has a config.json file with settings like:

Copy{
  "name": "Agent Name",
  "model": "ollama/llama3",
  "memory_path": "data/memory/agent.db",
  "log_path": "logs/agent.log",
  "interacts_with": ["other-agent-1", "other-agent-2"]
}
Environment Variables
Key environment variables in .env:

# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434/api/generate
MODEL_NAME=llama3:latest

# API Keys
PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key
ETSY_API_KEY=your_etsy_api_key
ETSY_API_SECRET=your_etsy_api_secret
PINTEREST_API_KEY=your_pinterest_api_key
STABLE_DIFFUSION_API_KEY=your_stable_diffusion_api_key

# Service Configuration
WORKERS_SERVICE_HOST=0.0.0.0
WORKERS_SERVICE_PORT=8000

# Learning System
ENABLE_LEARNING_SERVICE=true
Advanced Features
Self-Improvement Loop
The system includes a framework for agents to learn from past successes and failures:

Copy# Example of recording performance
agent.record_task_performance(
    task_type="seo_optimization",
    prompt="Optimize SEO for cat t-shirts",
    result="Generated 15 keywords...",
    score=0.85,
    feedback="Good keyword selection, could improve title length"
)

# Example of analyzing performance
performance_analysis = agent.analyze_performance()
Prompt Chain Optimization
Use sophisticated prompt chains for complex reasoning:

Copy# Example of executing a prompt chain
result = agent.execute_prompt_chain(
    chain_name="seo_keyword_expansion",
    input_text="cat t-shirts",
    additional_context={"category": "apparel"}
)
Multi-Modal Integration
Combine text and image analysis:

Copy# Example of analyzing a design image
analysis = agent.analyze_image(
    image_path="designs/cat_design_01.png",
    analysis_type="design_critique"
)

# Generate text based on an image
text = agent.generate_text_from_image(
    image_path="designs/cat_design_01.png",
    prompt="Create a product description for this design"
)
