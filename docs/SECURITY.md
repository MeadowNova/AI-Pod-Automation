# Security Guidelines for POD Automation System

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the POD Automation System and provides guidelines for secure deployment and operation.

## Security Features

### 1. Environment Variables for Secrets

- All sensitive data (API keys, credentials) is loaded from environment variables first, then falls back to config files if needed.
- The system uses a `.env` file for local development (excluded from source control).
- In production, use Docker secrets or a secrets manager for sensitive data.

### 2. Docker Security

- **Non-root User**: The container runs as a non-root user to limit potential damage from container breakouts.
- **Multi-stage Build**: Uses multi-stage builds to minimize image size and attack surface.
- **Port Restriction**: Ports are bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) to prevent external access.
- **Network Isolation**: Uses a dedicated Docker network for proper isolation.
- **Healthcheck**: Includes a healthcheck endpoint for monitoring container health.
- **Read-only Volumes**: Data volumes are mounted as read-only where possible.

### 3. File Security

- **Restrictive Permissions**: Config files are set with 600 permissions (owner read/write only).
- **Proper .dockerignore**: Sensitive files and directories are excluded from the Docker build context.
- **Secure Config Storage**: Configuration is stored outside of source control.

## Secure Deployment Guidelines

### Setting Up for Development

1. **Create a .env file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys and secrets
   ```

2. **Secure your config files**:
   ```bash
   ./secure_config.sh
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Use environment variables instead of .env file**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Set up a firewall**:
   - Restrict access to port 8501 to trusted IPs only.
   - Consider using a reverse proxy with TLS for secure access.

3. **Regular updates**:
   - Keep the base images updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
   - Regularly update dependencies in requirements.txt.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for the container healthcheck endpoint.
   - Implement logging and alerting for security events.

## API Key Security

- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for all connected services.
- **Least Privilege**: Use API keys with the minimum required permissions.
- **Revocation**: Have a process to quickly revoke compromised API keys.

## Network Security

- **Firewall**: Configure a firewall to restrict access to the application.
- **TLS**: Use TLS for all external communications.
- **VPN/Private Network**: Consider running the application in a private network or behind a VPN.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@example.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.
