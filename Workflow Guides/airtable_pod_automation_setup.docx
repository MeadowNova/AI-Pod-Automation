Airtable Setup Guide for POD Automation

Step 1: Create an Airtable Account and Base
- Sign up at https://airtable.com/ if you don't have an account.
- Create a new base (e.g., "POD Automation").

Step 2: Design Your Schema
- In your new base, create a main table called "Designs".
- Optionally, add tables for "Trends", "Market Analysis", or "Publishing Logs" if you want to track more data.

Step 3: Configure Fields in the "Designs" Table
Add the following fields (with recommended Airtable types):
- Design Name (Single line text)
- Description (Long text)
- Tags (Multiple select)
- Design File (Attachment or URL)
- Status (Single select: Ready, Published, Error, Needs Review)
- Product Type (Single select: T-shirt, Sweatshirt, Poster, Pillow Case, etc.)
- Collection (Multiple select or linked to a "Collections" table: Artist Collection, Meme Collection, etc.)
- Printify Product ID (Single line text)
- Etsy Listing ID (Single line text)
- Last Published (Date)
- Error Log (Long text)
- Add any additional fields you need for your workflow.

Step 4: Set Up Airtable API Access
- Go to your Airtable account settings and generate a personal access token.
- Note your base ID and table names.
- This will allow your Python scripts and agents to read from and write to your Airtable base programmatically.

Step 5: Prepare for Python Integration
- Install the pyairtable library: pip install pyairtable
- Write a test script to connect to your Airtable base using your API token and base ID.
- Verify you can read and write records in your "Designs" table.

Step 6: (Optional) Set Up Airtable Automations or Views
- Create filtered views for each product type, collection, or status (e.g., Ready, Published, Error).
- Set up email notifications or reminders for specific statuses if desired.
- This will help you monitor your automation pipeline at a glance.

Tips:
- Use "Product Type" and "Collection" fields to categorize and filter your designs.
- For advanced organization, create a separate "Collections" table and link it to "Designs".
- Test adding a few sample records to ensure your setup matches your workflow.

This structure will give you a scalable, organized, and automation-friendly foundation for your POD business in Airtable.
