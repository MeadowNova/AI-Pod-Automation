CARE INSTRUCTIONS
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
🔥 To keep your shirt looking pristine, please avoid ironing directly on the design. Instead, we recommend ironing on low heat with the shirt turned inside-out.

🚫 For the best results, DO NOT dry clean or bleach the shirt. Machine wash the shirt in cold water with mild detergent. Remember to turn the shirt inside out when washing to maintain its brilliance.

💨 When it's time to dry the shirt, use low heat settings or hang it up to dry gently.

⏳ For optimal longevity, we advise waiting 24 hours before the first wash to preserve the design's vibrancy.
